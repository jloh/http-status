This error indicates that the SSL handshake between Cloudflare and the website behind it has occurred. This means that Cloudflare is set to use Full SSL in the Cloudflare settings for the domain, so Cloudflare attempts to make a connection using SSL (for requests beginning in `https://`) to the web server that hosts the domain.

The most common causes include:

  * The website does not have a valid SSL certificate installed
  * The website is not listening on port `443`
  * The website does not support or is not configured properly to support SNI
  * The cipher suites that Cloudflare uses do not match what the origin accepts
