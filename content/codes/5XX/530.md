Cloudflare cannot resolve the A/AAAA or CNAME DNS record requested. Even if Cloudflare is resolving correctly, the record cannot be found or is a CNAME record to an external domain that cannot be resolved.

The Error Message the browser will see will show a 1016 error, but the actual HTTP response code is 530.

The most common causes are:

  * Your Cloudflare DNS configuration does not have an A/AAAA DNS record that matches the origin IP address.
  * You have a *CNAME DNS record* pointing to an external domain that cannot be resolved.
  * You're using Cloudflare [Load Balancer](https://www.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/) and the origin host names (CNAMEs) in your default/region and fallback pools cannot be resolved via DNS.
