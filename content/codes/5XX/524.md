Cloudflare was able to make a TCP connection to the website behind them, but it did not reply with an HTTP response before the connection timed out. Cloudflare will typically wait 100 seconds for a HTTP response from your server.

If no response is sent by your server in that time, Cloudflare closes the connection and serves a 524 error page.
