301 Moved Permanently indicates that the target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs. Links that result in a 301 should be edited to link directly to the final URI where possible.

The server SHOULD generate a `Location` header field in the response containing a preferred URI reference for the new permanent URI.  The user agent MAY use the Location field value for automatic redirection.  The server's response payload usually contains a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s) however this is optional.

This response is cachable.
