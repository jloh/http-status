  Cloudflare -->> User: Returns 526 error

This error happens where there's a problem validating the SSL certificate on the origin web server and the Cloudflare SSL configuration on the website is set to "Full SSL (Strict)".

Some of the common causes of this are:
  * The certificate has expired
  * The certificate has been revoked
  * The certificate is self-signed
  * Your website configuration is serving a certificate for the wrong domain
