The request timed out or failed after the WAN connection had been established. This could result from an interruption or anomaly upstream from the Railgun Sender in the path to the Listener at the site origin web server.

527 error could also occur due to an issue within the host environment when the Railgun Listener is unable to complete or establish a connection to the origin web server to receive a requested page.
