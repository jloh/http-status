This is a catch-all response for when a website behind Cloudflare returns something unexpected or something that is not tolerated/interpreted (protocol violation or empty response).

While the 520 error can be triggered by very unique and strange edge-case scenarios, they are generally caused by:

* Connection resets (following a successful TCP handshake)
* Headers exceed the Cloudflare header size limit (over 8kb)
* An empty response from origin
* An invalid HTTP response
* Missing response headers from an HTTP response
* Presence of multiple Content-Length headers
